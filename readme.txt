Argument Viewer 2.0
-------------------

The program can be invoked with arguments.

If no arguments are given, the program just displays its name (which is 
always the first argument in any case) with the length in bytes.

If the position in the file hierarchy has to be given by a

  ./

this is included in the count of the length.

If arguments are given, every argument will be listed on the terminal
followed by the length in bytes.

This program was written to test some features which will be needed in future
projects.
