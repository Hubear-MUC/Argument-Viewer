ArgumentViewer 1.0
------------------

A program viewing the arguments on the screen which are given at the invocation.

Just invoke after compilation with arguments, like this:

  argview a b c
  
Then the program lists the arguments given like this:

  a
  b
  c
  
and terminates.

This program is a trial to implement for example a file size viewer with the option to give the name of the file to measure by an argument of a file- content viewer or things like that.
